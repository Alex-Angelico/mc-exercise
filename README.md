Code Fellows Code 201 Lab 15A

1. When starting a new feature we didn't pull from from the most updated version of the repo.
2. Multiple branches were pushed at the same time.
3. Didn't have a communication plan on pushes.
4. Alice forgot to make a branch to work off of.

We learned where to find the conflicts and how to resolve them.
Make sure two groups aren't working on the same feature at the same time
Shouldn' try to merge directly to the main.
